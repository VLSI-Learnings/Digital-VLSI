# Verilog HDL Primer by J B

## Chapter 1

**What is HDL?**
HDL is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits, and most commonly, digital logic circuits.

**What is Verilog HDL?**
Verilog HDL is a hardware description language that can be used to model a digital systema many levels of abstraction ranging from the algorithmic level to the gate-level to the switch-level.\
(The Verilog HDLlanguagewas first developed by Gateway Design Automation(acquired by Cadence Design Systems) in 1983).

**Capabilities:**

1. Primitive logic gates, such as and, or and nand, are built-in into the language.
1. Flexibility of creating a user-defined primitive (UDP). Such as primitive could either be a combinational logic primitive or a sequential logic primitive.
1. Switch-level modeling primitive gates, such as pmos and nmos, are also built-in into the language.
1. A design can be modeled in three different styles or in a mixed style. These styles are:
  a. Behavioral style - modeled using procedural constructs
  a. Dataflow style - modeled using continuous assignments
  a. Structural style - modeled using gate and module instantiations.
