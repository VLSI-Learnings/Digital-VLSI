**What is HDL?**
HDL is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits, and most commonly, digital logic circuits.

**Why HDL?**

1. Concurrent execution of statements.
2. The language that converts the program(textual description) to a Netlist(Gate level netlist)
3. Some characteristics like propagation delay, interconnection of parts canâ€™t be captured with traditional languages.
   **Why need of concurrent processng?**
   1. Due to the complexity of digital circuits, we need to process all the instructions at the same time.
   2. To reduce the delay in output.

## Chapter 1

**What is Verilog HDL?**

* Verilog HDL is a hardware description language that can be used to model a digital systema many levels of abstraction ranging from the algorithmic level to the gate-level to the switch-level.
* The Verilog HDL language was first developed by Gateway Design Automation(acquired by Cadence Design Systems) in 1983.
  **Verilog is case-sensitive**

**Capabilities:**

1. Primitive logic gates, such as and, or and nand, are built-in into the language.
2. Flexibility of creating a user-defined primitive (UDP). Such as primitive could either be a combinational logic primitive or a sequential logic primitive.
3. Switch-level modeling primitive gates, such as pmos and nmos, are also built-in into the language.
4. Hierarchical designs can be described, up to any level, using the module instantiation construct.
5. Notion of concurrency and time can be explicitly modeled.
6. The language is non-deterministic under certain situations,that is, a model may produce different resultson different simulators; for example, the ordering of events on an event queue is not defined by the standard.
7. Explicit language constructs are provided for specifyingpin-topin delays, path delays and timing checks of a design.
8. The capabilities of the Verilog HDL language can be further extended by using the programming language interface (PLI) mechanism.
   **PLI is a collection of routines that allow foreign functions to access information within a Verilog module and allows for designer interaction with the simulator.**

## Chapter 2

**Module:**

* The basic unit of description in HDL is the module.
* A module describes the functionality or structure of a designand also describes the ports through which it communicates externally with other modules.
  Syntax of the module:

  ```verilog

    module module_name ( port_list ) ;
    //Declarations:
    input i1;
    output o1;
    inout x1;
    reg, wire, parameter,
    .
    //statements
    .
    endmodule
  ```

**Identifiers:**

* An identifier in Verilog HDL is any sequence of letters,digits,the $ character, and the _ (underscore) character, with the restriction that the first character must be a letter or an underscore.

**Keywords:**

* These are predefined identifiers which has specific meaning and used in certain context.
  * initial, always, begin, case, assign, and, or, xor
  * buf, casex, default, assign, bufif0, casez
  * defparam, bufif1, cmos, disable, etc
    **Note that only lowercase are keywords**

**Comments:**

* In verilog we can comment the description in two ways.
  * Multiple lines

    ```verilog
    /*
    Description
    */
    ```
  * Single line

    ```verilog
    //Description
    //Description
    ```

**Format:** Verilog is free format, statements can be written in a single line or multiple lines.

**Task:**

* Task is a reusable code that can be invoked from different parts of the design.
* A task can return zero or more values and can allows delays(mostly used in test benches).

**Function:**

* Function is like task but returns only one value.
* This executes at zero time and doesn't allow delays.

**System Task and Functions:** - An identifier starting with **$** character is system task of function.

```verilog
$display, $monitor
```

**Compiler Directives:**

* Identifiers that start with `(backquote) and when compiled, has its effect throughout the compilation process, until a different compiler directive specifies otherwise.
  * `define - Used for text substitution.

    ```verilog
    `define MAX_BUS_SIZE 32
    reg [`MAX_BUS_SIZE - 1:0] var;
    ```
  * `undef - Removes the previously defined.

    ```verilog
    `define WORD 16
    wire [`WORD : 1] var;
    `undef WORD
    ```
  * `ifdef,
  * `else,
  * `endif - These directives are used in conditional compilation.

    ```verilog
    `ifdef signal
    parameter WORD_SIZE =16;
    `else
    parameter WORD_SIZE =32;
    `endif
    ```


    During the compilation, if the text macro signal is defined the corresponding statement executes, and `else is optional.
  * `default_nettype - This is used to specify the **net** type for implicit net declarations.

    ```verilog
    `default_nettype wand
    ```
  * `include - This directive is used to replace the contents of the file in line

    ```verilog
    `include "full_path_of_file"
    ```
  * `resetall - This directive resets all the compiler directives to default. Exanple: causes net type to be wire.

    ```verilog
    `resetall
    ```
  * `timescale - The association of time units is done using this directive, specifies the time units and and time precision.

    ```verilog
    `timescale timeunit/time_precision
    `timescale 10ns/10ps
    ```


    If every is having its own timescale then the least precision is taken into account.
  * `unconnected_drive
  * `nounconnected_drive - All unconnected input ports that appear between these directives are connected to 0 or 1.

    ```verilog
    `unconnected_drive pull1
    `nounconnected_drive
    ```
  * `celldefine
  * `endcelldefine - These will mark the module as cell module(these modules are used by PLI routines for timing analysis etc).

    ```verilog
    `celldefine
    module FD1S3AX {D, CK, Z) ;
    endmodule
    `endcelldefine
    ```

**Vaule Set:**

* The 4 basic values in Verilog HDL are
  * 0 :logic-0orfalse
  * 1: logic-1 or true
  * x: unknown
  * z: high-impedance
* x and z are case insensitive.
* Constants are 3 types
  * Integer - represented in two formats

    * Simple decimal
      * 30, -15
    * Base format
      * [size]'base value
        ex: 4'b0101
      * Not legal formats
        * Space between ' character and base
        * Size can't be expression - (2+1)'b00000
        * value can't be negative
  * Real

    * Decimal format
      * 1.5, 2,670
    * Scientific format
      * 14_3.1e2 (=14310)(underscore is ignored)
      * 4e-2 (0.04)
  * string - A sequence of characters within the double quotes.

    ```verilog
    message = "Internal Error";
    reg [8*14:0] message;
    ```

**Data Types:**

* **Net**
  * Represents the physical connection between the elements.
  * If no driver is connected to net, default value is z.
  * wire, tri, wor, trior, wand, triand, trireg, tril, tri0, supply0, supply 1
    Syntax

    ```verilog
    net_type [msb:lsb] var
    ```
  * wire and tri are similar types but tri is used when multiple drivers drive a net.


    | wire(or tri) | 0 | 1 | x | z |
    | :-: | - | - | - | - |
    | 0 | 0 | x | x | 0 |
    | 1 | x | 1 | x | 1 |
    | x | x | x | x | x |
    | z | 0 | 1 | x | z |
  * wor and trior


    | wor(or trior) | 0 | 1 | x | z |
    | :-: | - | - | - | - |
    | 0 | 0 | 1 | x | 0 |
    | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
    | x | x | 1 | x | x |
    | z | 0 | 1 | x | z |
  * wand and triand


    | wand(or triand) | 0 | 1 | x | z |
    | :-: | - | - | - | - |
    | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    | 1 | 0 | 1 | x | 1 |
    | x | 0 | x | x | x |
    | z | 0 | 1 | x | z |

## Chapter 3

**Assignment Statements(AS):**

* Continous AS
  * The logic derived from the RHS drives the net in LHS.
  * The target of the CAS is always a net driven by combo logic.
* Procedural AS
  * The logic derived from the RHS drives the variable on the LHS.
  * These always appear in always block.
  * There are two kinds of PAS :
    * Blocking
      * The execution of the statements is seqential(The assignment to LHS is before the execution of the next assignment).
      * This is used in combo logic.
    * Non Blocking
      * The execution of the statements is parallel(The assignment to LHS is end of the cycle).
      * This is used in Sequential logic.

**Delay:**

* Interdelay - The time by which the execution of the statement is delayed.

  ```verilog
  assign #10 a=b^c;
  ```
* Intradelay - The time by which the assignment of the RHS to the LHS is delayed.

  ```verilog
  assign a=#10 b^c;
  ```

**Modelling Styles:**

A design can be modeled in three different styles or in a mixed style. These styles are:

* **Dataflow style**
  * The basic mechanism used to modela design in the dataflow style is the continuous assignment.
  * In a continuous assignment, a value is assigned to a net.

    ```text
    assign [delay] LHS=RHS;
    ```
* **Behavioral style**
  * Design is modelled using procedural assignments.
  * This has two statements.
    * Initial statement - Executes only once.

      ```verilog
      initial begin
        clk=1'b0;
      end
      ```
    * Always statement - Executes in a loop based on the sensitivity list(**sentivity list** - variables that are required to execute the block when they change).

      ```verilog
      always @ ("sentivity list") begin
        //statements
      end
      ```
* **Structural style**
  * This is modelled using primitives.
    * Built-in gate primitives (at the gate-level
    * Switch-levelprimitives (at the transistor-level)
    * User-defined primitives (at the gate-level
    * Module instances (to create hierarchy)

    ```verilog
    and a1(out, in1, in2)
    fulladder f1(sum, carry, a, b, c)
    ```
* **Mixed style**
  * The design is made using of all the above styles.

Simulating a Design

* Verilog HDL provides capabilities not only to escribe a design but also to model stimulus, control, storing responses and verification, all using the same language. Stimulus and control can be generated using initial statements.
