# Verilog HDL Primer by J B

## Chapter 1

**What is HDL?**\
HDL is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits, and most commonly, digital logic circuits.

**Why HDL?**

1. Concurrent execution of statements.
2. The language that converts the program(textual description) to a Netlist(Gate level netlist)
3. Some characteristics like propagation delay, interconnection of parts canâ€™t be captured with traditional languages.
    **Why need of concurrent processng?**
      1. Due to the complexity of digital circuits, we need to process all the instructions at the same time.
      2. To reduce the delay in output.

**What is Verilog HDL?**\
Verilog HDL is a hardware description language that can be used to model a digital systema many levels of abstraction ranging from the algorithmic level to the gate-level to the switch-level.\
(The Verilog HDL language was first developed by Gateway Design Automation(acquired by Cadence Design Systems) in 1983).

**Capabilities:**

1. Primitive logic gates, such as and, or and nand, are built-in into the language.
2. Flexibility of creating a user-defined primitive (UDP). Such as primitive could either be a combinational logic primitive or a sequential logic primitive.
3. Switch-level modeling primitive gates, such as pmos and nmos, are also built-in into the language.
4. Hierarchical designs can be described, up to any level, using the module instantiation construct.
5. Notion of concurrency and time can be explicitly modeled.
6. A design can be modeled in three different styles or in a mixed style. These styles are:
   1. Behavioral style - modeled using procedural constructs.
   2. Dataflow style - modeled using continuous assignments.
   3. Structural style - modeled using gate and module instantiations.
