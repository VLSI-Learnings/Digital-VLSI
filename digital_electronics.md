# Digitial Electronics(NPTEL & Morris Mano)

## All the topics of Digital Electronics are here

* [Chapter 1](https://github.com/VLSI-Learnings/Digital-VLSI/blob/master/digitial_electronics.md#chapter-1) - Basics
* [Chapter 2](https://github.com/VLSI-Learnings/Digital-VLSI/blob/master/digitial_electronics.md#chapter-2)

### Chapter 1

* Definitions
  * **Signal** - Information that represents the variation of physical quantity with respect to a parameter.
  * **Analog Signal** - The dependent parameter that can any value defined within the limits as a function of the independent parameters.
  * **Discrete Signal** - The dependent parameter is defined for particular values of the independent parameter.
  * **Digital Signal** - The signal which is discrete in both dependent parameter and independent parameter.
  * **Transducer** - THe device which converts non electrical signal to electric signal.

* Y's
  * Noise immunity
    * Because of the levels, eventhough when the noise is added cancelled due to the levels.
  * Less use of bandwidth.
  * Efficiency of long distance transmission.
